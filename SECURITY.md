## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by emailing the maintainers or opening a private GitHub issue. Do **not** disclose security issues publicly until they have been reviewed and patched.

- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- All dependencies must be regularly reviewed
- Input validation and error handling are enforced
- See [GitGuardian](https://www.gitguardian.com/) for best practices
